Online Food Order Feedback Prediction using RNN

This project aims to predict the feedback (positive or negative) of online food orders using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. The model analyzes various features related to the online food orders and predicts whether the feedback will be positive or negative.
